# Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV) policy

The current MSRV is **Rust 1.88** (stable channel).

The MSRV is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` at the repository root and declared in every workspace crate via `rust-version = "1.88"`.

## How the MSRV evolves

- autocommit does not commit to supporting Rust versions older than 1.88.
- An MSRV bump is treated as a **minor** version bump per the [semver policy](SEMVER_POLICY.md). For example, raising the MSRV from 1.88 to 1.92 ships in a `0.X.0` release (or `X.0.0` once at 1.0).
- The current MSRV is documented in CHANGELOG.md under the `Changed` section of the release that bumps it.

## Why we pick the floor we pick

- **1.88** is required because autocommit uses Rust edition 2024 features.
- Future bumps will be driven by concrete features the tool needs, not by chasing the latest stable.

## How we verify the MSRV in CI

The repository CI pins `rust-toolchain.toml` to `1.88.0`. The `Format`, `Clippy` and `Build and test` jobs all run on this exact toolchain, which guarantees that nothing newer slips in.

## Downstream impact

If you build autocommit from source, the dependency resolver will refuse to compile it on a Rust version older than the MSRV. Pre-built binaries distributed via scoop are unaffected by your local Rust version.
